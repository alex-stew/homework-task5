<h2>How to use: </h2>
<p>This is an appointment planning app that allows the user to input tasks, meetings or reminders to guide their day. The application runs through 9am - 5pm.

The colorways within the css and js assist in displaying relative times as: gray (past), red (present) and green (future).</p>
