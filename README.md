<h2>How to use: </h2>
<p>This is an appointment planning app that allows the user to input tasks, meetings or reminders to guide their day. The application runs through 9am - 5pm. The application gets the data to handle time through the moment.js library. User inputted tasks are saved to using the localStorage of the browser. The colorways within the css and js assist in displaying relative times as: gray (past), red (present) and green (future).</p>
